          Noche de Ciencias at Manhattan Bridges High \
          School in April 2017. The following academic year, she became part\
          of the PCED 2018 team by creating a meaningful project along her \
          team that exposed high school students to leadership and real-life\
          experiences. Last academic year, Arelis was part of the Executive\
          Board for LAESA, serving as the External Vice-President. This year\

        the reasons I picked these positions are because I like to be\
        organized and also work on self-development. Some hobbies that I'm\
        into are basketball, health ( mental and physical), reading books on\
        personal growth and listening to podcast. Laesa-shpe has opened many\

            <p>
              LAESAâ€“SHPE is the largest and most prominent undergraduate student
              organization at The City College of New York. In 1983, a group of
              dedicated students, with the goal to unite all Latino and other
              minority engineering students, share cultural ideas, and promote
              leadership, founded LAESA within City College. In 1986, LAESA
              joined forces with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
              (SHPE) to better achieve their goals and connect with a larger
              body of professionals. This partnership has flourished over the
              years and today, LAESA is a firm supporter of the SHPE core
              values, while remaining true to its original mission. With over
              150 members, LAESA-SHPE has been able to gather motivated students
              from all engineering disciplines and a diverse pool of cultural
              backgrounds. This dynamic group of students, alongside their
              highly supportive alumni members, has had many achievements at The
              City College of New York and within the community.
