          <h2> About LAESA-SHPE </h2>
          <p className="body">
            LAESAâ€“SHPE is the largest and most prominent undergraduate student
            organization at The City College of New York. In 1983, a group of
            dedicated students, with the goal to unite all Latino and other
            minority engineering students, share cultural ideas and promote
            leadership, founded LAESA within City College. In 1986, LAESA joined
            forces with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to
            better achieve their goals and connect with a larger body of
            professionals. This partnership has flourished over the years and
            today, LAESA is a firm supporter of the SHPE core values, while
            remaining true to its original mission. With over 150 members,
            LAESA-SHPE has been able to gather motivated students from all
            engineering disciplines and a diverse pool of cultural backgrounds.
            This dynamic group of students, alongside their highly supportive
            alumni members, has had many achievements at The City College of New
            York and within the community. Some of our accomplishments are
            listed below:
