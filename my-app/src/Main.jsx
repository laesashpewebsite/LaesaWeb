          <h2> About LAESA-SHPE </h2>
          <p className="body">
            LAESAâ€“SHPE is the largest and most prominent undergraduate student
            organization at The City College of New York. In 1983, a group of
            dedicated students, to unite all Latino and other minority
            engineering students, share cultural ideas and promote leadership,
            founded LAESA within City College. In 1986, LAESA joined forces with
            the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to better
            achieve their goals and connect with a larger body of professionals.
            This partnership has flourished over the years and today, LAESA is a
            firm supporter of the SHPE core values, while remaining true to its
            original mission. With over 150 members, LAESA-SHPE has been able to
            gather motivated students from all engineering disciplines and a
            diverse pool of cultural backgrounds. This dynamic group of
            students, alongside their highly supportive alumni members, has had
            many achievements at The City College of New York and within the
            community. Some of our accomplishments are listed below:
