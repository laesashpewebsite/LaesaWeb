    <h2> About LAESA-SHPE </h2>
      <p className="body">
      LAESAâ€“SHPE is the largest and most prominent undergraduate student
      organization at The City College of New York. In 1983, a group of
      dedicated students, with the goal to unite all Latino and other
      minority engineering students, share cultural ideas, and promote
      leadership, founded LAESA within City College. In 1986, LAESA joined
      forces with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to
      better achieve their goals and connect with a larger body of
      professionals. This partnership has flourished over the years and
      today, LAESA is a firm supporter of the SHPE core values, while
      remaining true to its original mission. With over 150 members,
      LAESA-SHPE has been able to gather motivated students from all
      engineering disciplines and a diverse pool of cultural backgrounds.
      This dynamic group of students, alongside their highly supportive
      alumni members, has had many achievements at The City College of New
      York and within the community.
