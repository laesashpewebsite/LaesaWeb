        	<p>
        	LAESAâ€“SHPE is the largest and most prominent undergraduate student organization 
       		at The City College of New York. In 1983, a group of dedicated students, with the 
        	goal to unite all Latino and other minority engineering students, share cultural ideas,
        	and promote leadership, founded LAESA within City College. In 1986, LAESA joined forces 
        	with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to better achieve their goals 
        	and connect with a larger body of professionals. This partnership has flourished over the
        	years and today, LAESA is a firm supporter of the SHPE core values, while remaining true to
        	its original mission. With over 150 members, LAESA-SHPE has been able to gather motivated 
        	students from all engineering disciplines and a diverse pool of cultural backgrounds. This
        	dynamic group of students, alongside their highly supportive alumni members, has had many 
        	achievements at The City College of New York and within the community
